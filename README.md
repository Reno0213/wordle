When the game is launched, you will see an empty grid, signifying the beginning of the Wordle game. 
You are given 6 attempts to enter words consisting of 5 letters, to guess the correct word.
The beginning of the game appears as seen below:

As the game progresses, you will be given indications via colored tiles, informing you regarding the accuracy of your guesses. If the tile remains grey, the letter does not exist in the word. If the tile becomes yellow, the letter exists but is not in the correct spot. If the tile is green, the letter both exists in the word, and is in the correct spot.
